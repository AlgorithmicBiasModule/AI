<h2 class="movemid">About the Module: An Introduction to Algorithmic Bias in Health Care for Clinicians</h2>
<p>This module is based on an extensive literature review of artificial intelligence and ethics, and algorthmic bias that was completed in Fall 2021. Relevant papers were analyzed for concepts of algorithmic bias and those concepts were placed into related themes. The initial review revealed 86 on topic articles from the previous 5 years with 886 instances of 141 concepts across 8 themes. To inform the development of a training module, the 5 most common concepts were compiled. Additional references were used as needed to fill in gaps. This module was created as part of a Capstone Project for an M.S. degree in biomedical informatics at OHSU. The initial release period for the module is part of a study on the Development of an Online Teaching Module for Clinicians on Algorithmic Bias. The study period will be be from May 25, 2022 to June 8, 2022 (tentative, pending IRB approval). The study will include collection of anonymous responses to the pre-module and post-module surveys in order to inform practices for training clinicians on artificial intelligence in health care. Comments from the Disqus pages for each of the case questions will not be used in this study. Additionally, any feedback provided via email will not be used. Participation by submitting the Qualtrics survey forms is encouraged but it is not a mandatory part of the module. Version 1 of the module released on May 25, 2022 (tentative, pending IRB approval).  </p><br>
